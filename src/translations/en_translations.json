  "whatIsOwnPathQuestion": "What is OwnPath?",
  "whatIsOwnPathAnswer": "Recognizing that we are all striving for wellbeing, OwnPath provides individuals with a resource to begin their own path to wellness, no matter where in the journey they are. The searchable online directory allows people in Colorado to find behavioral health providers licensed by the Behavioral Health Administration (BHA) and to search for specific services or use a guided search to identify providers or resources that best meet their needs. Searches can be narrowed by criteria such as location, days of operation, language support, payment types accepted, and more.\n\n“OwnPath is a new resource for Coloradans to further provide people with access to behavioral health services when they need them most. We are committed to expanding affordable mental health resources in our state to save people money and make sure every Coloradan has the opportunity to thrive,” said Gov. Polis. “I commend Dr. Medlock and behavioral health workers for their dedication and commitment to improving the lives of our neighbors, friends and family members.”\n\n“The concept of OwnPath is new to the state of Colorado, and should tremendously improve access to care. This is the BHA’s first step in building a reimagined behavioral health system,” said BHA Commissioner, Dr. Morgan Medlock.",
  "whyQuestion": "Why did BHA decide to build this tool?\n",
  "whyAnswer": "The BHA heard from people in Colorado that a website that improves access to behavioral health services and builds trust with community members is imperative to improving health and wellbeing in Colorado. OwnPath is one of many steps the BHA is taking to support people in Colorado.\n",
  "addressingInequalityQuestion": "How is OwnPath designed to address inequality?\n",
  "addressingInequalityAnswer": "OwnPath was designed with a human-centered approach to ensure belonging and inclusion for all. OwnPath strives to address inequality by designing in alignment with trauma-informed, culturally humble, and radically innovative community-informed practices. This thoughtful and intentional approach ensures that People in Colorado regardless of severity of need, ability to pay, disability, linguistics, geographic location, racial or ethnic identity, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, age, or gender identity have equitable access to meaningful mental health and substance-use disorder services. ",
  "missingProvidersQuestion": "Why aren’t all providers in Colorado listed? ",
  "missingProvidersAnswer": "As of right now, OwnPath consists of providers licensed through the BHA. We do acknowledge that the current set of entities may not encompass all facilities providing behavioral health services throughout the state and we are actively working towards including a larger set of these facilities in the directory. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we iteratively incorporate these additional sites and encourage you to tune back in to the site for more provider information as it becomes available.\n",
  "updateInfoQuestion": "How can I add or update my facility information if I am a provider?",
  "updateInfoAnswer": "As of right now, OwnPath consists of providers licensed through the BHA. If your provider information is currently included in the OwnPath directory, please visit the [Colorado BHA for Providers website](https://www.colorado.gov/LADDERS/OBH_For_Providers) to update your information in the LADDERS platform. If you would like to be licensed or designated by the BHA, and are willing to comply with [2 CCR 502-1](https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/DisplayRule.do?action=ruleinfo&ruleId=2157&deptID=9&agencyID=70&deptName=Department%20of%20Human), please visit the [provider website](https://www.colorado.gov/LADDERS/OBH_For_Providers) to sign up and learn more about the process. All updates to the provider data will appear in OwnPath in 5-7 business days.\n\nIf you do not wish to pursue licensure from the BHA, we are actively working to set up a process for your information to be verified for publication on OwnPath. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we iteratively improve the site to include more providers in Colorado.",
  "increaseAccessQuestion": "What else is BHA doing to increase access to providers?\n",
  "increaseAccessAnswer": "In the midst of a widespread mental health crisis, this resource will be critical to ensure all people in Colorado have easy, approachable access to information on the services available to them. To draw more professionals to community-based behavioral health positions, the BHA is looking to incentivize behavioral health education and career tracks for students and increase pay for behavioral health workers. ",
  "accessibilityQuestion": "How does the BHA plan to address and improve accessibility and belonging for users?\n",
  "accessibilityAnswer": "The BHA plans to make changes such as training behavioral health professionals to respond respectfully to varying cultures, languages, and other considerations affecting marginalized populations. The BHA also plans to standardize guidelines across payer systems to make it easier for providers to enroll in public and private insurance networks and for patients to access. A final  example to address accessibility is to have an adequate, equitable, and complete continuum of behavioral health services, and address current disparities. \n\nFor user accessibility, the website is accessible to people with differing physical disabilities, such as blindness and low sight, deaf and hard of hearing, and mobile limitations restricting mouse movement. OwnPath strives to use clear, plain language, people-first language and transcultural translation to enhance the usability for all people of Colorado. The website is built for low-bandwidth scenarios and mobile-first usage. \n",
