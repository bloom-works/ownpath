The searchable online directory allows people in Colorado to find behavioral health providers licensed by the BHA and to search for specific services or use a guided search to identify providers or resources that best meet their needs. Searches can be narrowed by criteria such as location, days of operation, language support, payment types accepted, and more.",
          "\"Ownpath is a new resource for Coloradans to further provide people with access to behavioral health services when they need them the most. We are committed to expanding affordable mental health resources in our state to save people money and make sure every Coloradan has the opportunity to thrive,\" said Gov. Polis. \"I commend Dr. Medlock and the behavioral health workers for their dedicated and commitment to improving the lives of our neighbors, friends, and family members.\"",
          "\"The concept of OwnPath is new to the state of Colorado, and should tremendously improve access to care. This is the BHA's first step in building a reimagined behavioral health system,\" said BHA Commissioner, Dr. Morgan Medlock."
